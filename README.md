# Hi, I'm Malay Anand ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend developer focused on designing and building scalable, reliable systems. My experience spans developing distributed services in Go, integrating complex data pipelines, and architecting event-driven solutions.

I believe the next generation of software will deeply integrate AI into its core, rather than treating it as an afterthought. I'm excited about building robust systems ready to evolve with this shift.
